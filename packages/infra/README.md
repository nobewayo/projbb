# Infra Package (Planned)

This package will consolidate infrastructure tooling (Docker Compose, deployment manifests, config schemas) that support local development and CI/CD workflows described in Master Spec v3.7 §§17–18, 21.

## Upcoming Tasks
- Author Docker Compose stacks for Postgres, Redis, API, WS, and client services.
- Provide seed scripts and volume management for reproducible local environments.
- Document environment variable management and config hot-reload workflows.
- Prepare CI helper scripts for smoke tests and health check verification.
